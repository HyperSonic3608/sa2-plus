This is a work in progress matching decompilation of Sonic Advance 2

It so far builds the following ROMs:
* [**sa2.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0890) `sha1: 7bcd6a07af7c894746fa28073fe0c0e34408022d` (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)
* [**sa2_europe.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0900) `sha1: b0f64bdca097f2de8f05ac4c8caea2b80c5faeb1` (Europe) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)
* [**sa2_japan.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0799) `sha1: dffd0188fc78154b42b401398a224ae0713edf23` (Japan) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It) (:warning: Work in Progress)

The repo also builds the following:
* **sa2.sdl** `make sdl` (Linux/MacOS SDL 64bit port)
* **sa2.sdl_win32.exe** `make sdl_win32` (Windows SDL 32bit port)
* **sa2.win32.exe** `make win32` (Win32 native port, not functional)

### Current state

- :tada: The build is 100% from C files with [~80 functions which currently don't match](./asm/non_matching)
- All assembly code extracted, disassembled, and decompiled by hand to their C equivilent
- All songs have been extracted, and documented as [matching MIDI files](./sound/songs/midi)
- All sprite animation frames have been [extracted to PNGs and are used to build the matching rom](./graphics/obj_tiles)
- All tilemaps (backgrounds) have been documented and [had their tiles extracted](./data/tilemaps)
- The game compiles to a widescreen port (*426x240*) for multiple platforms
- The "sub games" (Chao Garden and Collect The Rings) have been disassembled but not yet decompiled

### Setting up the repository

**Dev container**

If you use `vscode` then consider using the provided [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) which skips the requirement for any setup. This requires docker is installed on your system. Once running, skip to *Build the GBA rom*

**Install system requirements** *(without dev container)*
 
On Linux systems
```
sudo apt install build-essential binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi libpng-dev xorg-dev libsdl2-dev gcc-mingw-w64 libarchive-tools
```

On MacOS install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM) (if building for GBA) and

```
brew install libpng sdl2 mingw-w64
```

On windows install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM)

***Install `agbcc` into the repo (skip if not compiling for the GBA)***

Clone the [agbcc](https://github.com/sa2/agbcc) repo into another folder

Inside the `agbcc` folder, run `./build.sh` and then install the compiler in this repo `./install.sh path/to/sa2`

**Build the GBA rom**

On Linux and MacOS, run `make` in the root of the repo to build.

On Windows you can build using `make` in the MSYS environment provided with devkitARM.

This command will also build all the required tooling in the `tools` directory. 
The `tools` directory contains a bunch of tooling (built by [pret](https://github.com/pret)) which is used to build assets and create a matching rom.

If the rom built successfully you will see this output

```bash
sa2.gba: OK
```

**Build the port**

For Windows: `make sdl_win32` 

**NOTE**: When building for Windows, you'll need to [download](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.30.3/SDL2-devel-2.30.3-mingw.zip) and extract SDL2 to the `ext` folder in the root of the repo before building. You can use `make SDL2.dll` to do this for you.

For Linux and MacOS: `make sdl`

**NOTE**: You can significantly speed up initial build times by passing the number of processes you wish to use for the build `make ... -j<number of CPU cores>`

### Code formatting

All C code in this repo is formatted with `clang-format-13`. If using the Dev Container this is installed automatically.

To format code run `make format`

### Notes

- The [Kirby & The Amazing Mirror](https://github.com/jiangzhengwenjz/katam/) decompilation uses a very similar codebase, as it was written by the same dev team (Dimps)
- https://decomp.me is a great resource for helping to create matching functions
- `ldscript.txt` tells the linker the order which files should be linked
- For more info, see the [FAQs section](https://zelda64.dev/games/tmc) of TMC
